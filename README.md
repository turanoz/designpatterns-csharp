## Design Patterns in C#

This project contains examples of popular design patterns implemented in the C# language

### Projects and Contents

1. `Singleton`: Contains an implementation of the Singleton design pattern, which ensures that only one instance of a class is created.

2. `Factory Method`: Contains an implementation of the Factory Method design pattern, which delegates the creation of objects to a "factory" class.

3. `Abstract Factory`: Contains an implementation of the Abstract Factory design pattern, which provides an interface for creating related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4. `Prototype`: Contains an implementation of the Prototype design pattern, which allows objects to be copied or cloned.

5. `Builder`: Contains an implementation of the Builder design pattern, which separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

6. `Facade`: Contains an implementation of the Facade design pattern, which provides a simplified interface to a complex system.

7. `Adapter`: Contains an implementation of the Adapter design pattern, which allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

8. `Composite`: Contains an implementation of the Composite design pattern, which treats objects as if they were part of a hierarchy.

9. `Proxy`: Contains an implementation of the Proxy design pattern, which provides a placeholder for another object and controls access to it.

10. `Decorator`: Contains an implementation of the Decorator design pattern, which dynamically extends the behavior of an object.

11. `Bridge`: Contains an implementation of the Bridge design pattern, which separates an abstraction from its implementation.

12. `Strategy`: Contains an implementation of the Strategy design pattern, which encapsulates interchangeable behaviors and selects them at runtime.

13. `Observer`: Contains an implementation of the Observer design pattern, which allows one object to notify other objects of its state changes.

14. `Chain of Responsibility`: Contains an implementation of the Chain of Responsibility design pattern, which allows a chain of objects to handle a request.

15. `Memento`: Contains an implementation of the Memento design pattern, which allows an object to capture and restore its internal state.

16. `Template Method`: Contains an implementation of the Template Method design pattern, which defines the skeleton of an algorithm and lets subclasses redefine certain steps.

17. `State`: Contains an implementation of the State design pattern, which allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

18. `Mediator`: Contains an implementation of the Mediator design pattern, which defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.

19. `Command`: Contains an implementation of the Command design pattern, which encapsulates a request as an object, allowing it to be passed as a parameter.

20. `Visitor`: Contains an implementation of the Visitor design pattern, which allows a new operation to be defined without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.

21. `Dependency Injection`: Contains an implementation of the Dependency Injection design pattern, which allows the creation of objects with their dependencies injected from the outside.

22. `Null Object`: Contains an implementation of the Null Object design pattern, which provides a no-op object that conforms to an interface.

23. `Multiton`: Contains an implementation of the Multiton design pattern, which ensures that only a fixed number of instances of a class are created.
